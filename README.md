# Traffic-management
Summary: This project is to detect unauthorized parking on forbidden roadsides. It uses an array of sensors to detect vehicles and starts loud beeps when the threshold time is crossed while the vehicle is not moving. After 20 beep alerts, a plate embedded with pins comes up from underneath of the road and punctures the tires. Simultaneously it sends a signal using the internet of things to the control center with a live video feature.

Hardware:
It consists of mainly two parts there are Detection System, Monitoring system. The monitoring system is divided into two parts, one of them is real-time detection monitoring and the another is video monitoring. Detection system is implemented using Arduino and monitoring system used esp32 and esp32 Cam for being monitored.

Detection System : IR Sensor, Buzzer, Servo Motor
Monitoring system:ESP32,ESP32 CAM
